title: Neonatal tolerance and patent filarial infection
organization: Rajan, T.V.
notes: Lymphatic filariasis occurs in endemic pockets. Patent infections with long-term, high-grade microfilaremia do not develop in nonendemic individuals. It is tempting to speculate that individuals with intact immune responses to filarial antigens are capable of dealing with filarial exposure without developing persistent infection. There are published data that support the idea that only those individuals who are impaired in their immune defense against these parasites owing to neonatal tolerization become productively infected with the filarial parasites. If the model is correct, there are profound implications for global eradication.
