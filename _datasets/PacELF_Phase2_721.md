title: The transplacental passage of malaria parasites in the Solomon Islands
organization: Marshall, D.E.
notes: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the extent of transplacental passage of malaria parasites in affected women attending for delivery at Kilu'ufi Hospital, Malaita Province, Solomon Islands. 11 women had parasitaemia and in 10 of these the placenta was infected. Transplacental passage occurred in five. Parasites were identified in one infant. The low parasitaemia in cord blood suggests that passage is accidental and probably occurs in labour. Where parasite transfer occurred there was no evidence of clinical illness in the newborn child. There were three stillborn infants and three infants of low birth weight. This small study confirms that the placenta provides an effective barrier during malaria in pregnancy.
