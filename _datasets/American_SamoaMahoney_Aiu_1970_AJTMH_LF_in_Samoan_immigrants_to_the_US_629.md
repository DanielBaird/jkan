title: Filariasis in Samoan immigrants to the United States
organization: Mahoney Jr., L.E., Aiu, P.
notes: A survey for filariasis was done among 178 Samoan immigrants living in California and Hawaii; 14% were found to have microfilaremia. All positive blood films were from persons who had been away from endemic areas for 8 years or less. Microfilaria rates differed considerably from those in Samoa. Only a small fraction of the persons tested showed symptoms of filariasis. Although competent vectors are present, it is unlikely that the infection will be established in the United States. The prevalence of filariasis in Samoan immigrants can be expected to decline as a secondary effect of a control program in American Samoa.
