notes: The aim of this module is to contribute to the prevention of suffering and disability due to LF by training health and non-health workers (e.g., social workers, teachers, religious leaders) at the district level, who in turn will train others how to teach the principles of home-based self-care to LF sufferers and their relatives in order to prevent the chronic consequences of the disease. It has been developed following extensive field-testing in Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania.
