PacELF, the first regional filariasis elimination programme, is a network of the twenty-two Pacific island countries and territories aimed at eliminating filariasis in the Pacific. The strategy for achieving this goal is annual mass drug administration (MDA) using diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) with albendazole to stop transmission, together with clinical management of infections to minimize progression of morbidity and disability in those individuals that are already infected.

A collection of hard copy documents is housed at James Cook University's Townsville Campus and may be accessed by request to PacELF@jcu.edu.au The development of this digital library is ongoing.
